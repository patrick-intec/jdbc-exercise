# JDBC - BeersDB exercise

Welcome to the BeersDB exercise.  

## The goal of this exercise.

There are a few goals we want to attain with this exercise:
* Give you a better grip on using JDBC
* Give you a better understanding of layering your application
* Show you why interfaces are so f-ing awesome
* Introduce you to the first _design pattern_: namely the 'Factory'

## Launcing the application
To start the application. Use the Main.main() method. When opening the Launcher class, you will notice that some IDEs will give you the option to run the Launcher class using the main() method inherited from the Application class. Feel free to try this, but most of you will notice that your application will exit with the following error code:

```
Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application
```

This should not happen when launching the application using the Main.main() method.
